Introduction: Why Parallel Scripting?
------------------------------------

Swift is a simple scripting language for executing many instances of
ordinary application programs on distributed parallel resources.
Swift scripts run many copies of ordinary programs concurrently, using
statements like this:
-----
foreach protein in proteinList {
  runBLAST(protein);
}
-----
Swift acts like a structured "shell" language. It runs programs
concurrently as soon as their inputs are available, reducing the need
for complex parallel programming.  Swift expresses your workflow in a
portable fashion: The same script runs on multicore computers,
clusters, clouds, grids, and supercomputers. 

This tutorial contains *two sections*. In the first section you will be able to try a few
Swift examples on your local machine, to get a sense of the language. Then in the 
second section you will run similar workflows on remote resources such as Midway, 
distributed OSG Connect resources, Cray, etc., and learn how to instruct Swift to run 
jobs in different places. You will also see how more 
complex workflows can be expressed with Swift scripts.

Swift installation
------------------
-----
$ wget http://swiftlang.org/packages/swift-0.95-RC6.tar.gz  # Download the file
$ tar xfz swift-0.95-RC6.tar.gz   # Extract the file
$ export PATH=/path/to/swift-0.95-RC6/bin:$PATH   # Add to PATH
-----

Tutorial scripts installation
-----------------------------
Run the following commands to extract these tutorial scripts. [red]#<fix?>#

-----
wget https://github.com/yadudoc/swift-on-cloud/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
mv swift-on-cloud-master swift-on-cloud
cd swift-on-cloud/swift-cloud-tutorial
-----
////
$ cd $HOME
$ wget http://swiftlang.org/tutorials/midway/swift-midway-tutorial.tar.gz
$ tar xvfz swift-midway-tutorial.tar.gz
$ cd swift-midway-tutorial
////

Run the tutorial setup script
-----
$ source setup.sh   # You must run this with "source" !
-----
Doing this will add the sample applications `simulate` and `stats` (explained in the next part) and 
some other functionalities to your local `$PATH` for you to run the tutorial.

In the tutorial directory you will find six `partNN` folders. Each part contains one Swift example that serves to 
demonstrate different functions for the workflow tutorial. `part01` to `part03` contain 
Swift scripts for running jobs locally. `part04` to `part06` contain scripts for running jobs on remote 
resources that you have access to, with corresponding configurations. Further explanations on these will 
be in Section Two of this tutorial.

.To check out the tutorial scripts from SVN

If you later want to get the most recent version of this tutorial from
the Swift Subversion repository, do:

-----
$ svn co https://svn.ci.uchicago.edu/svn/vdl2/SwiftTutorials/swift-localhost-tutorial  <fix>

This will create a directory called "swift-localhost-tutorial" which contains all of the files 
used in this tutorial. [red]#<fix name>#

.Verify your environment

To verify that Swift has successfully loaded, run:
-----
$ swift -version # verify that you have Swift 0.95 RC6

[NOTE]
=====
If you re-login or open new ssh sessions, you must re-run `source setup.sh` in each 
ssh shell/window.

Simple sample "science applications" for the workflow tutorial
--------------------------------------------------------------

This tutorial is based on two intentionally trivial example programs,
`simulation.sh` and `stats.sh`, (implemented as bash shell scripts)
that serve as easy-to-understand proxies for real science
applications. These "programs" behave as follows.

simulate.sh
~~~~~~~~~~~

The simulation.sh script serves as a trivial proxy for any more
complex scientific simulation application. It generates and prints a
set of one or more random integers in the range [0-2^62) as controlled
by its command line arguments, which are:

-----
$ ./app/simulate.sh --help
./app/simulate.sh: usage:
    -b|--bias       offset bias: add this integer to all results [0]
    -B|--biasfile   file of integer biases to add to results [none]
    -l|--log        generate a log in stderr if not null [y]
    -n|--nvalues    print this many values per simulation [1]
    -r|--range      range (limit) of generated results [100]
    -s|--seed       use this integer [0..32767] as a seed [none]
    -S|--seedfile   use this file (containing integer seeds [0..32767]) one per line [none]
    -t|--timesteps  number of simulated "timesteps" in seconds (determines runtime) [1]
    -x|--scale      scale the results by this integer [1]
    -h|-?|?|--help  print this help
$
-----

All of thess arguments are optional, with default values indicated above as `[n]`.

////
.simulation.sh arguments
[width="80%",cols="^2,10",options="header"]

|=======================
|Argument|Short|Description
|1    |runtime: sets run time of simulation.sh in seconds
|2    |range: limits generated values to the range [0,range-1]
|3    |biasfile: add the integer contained in this file to each value generated
|4    |scale: multiplies each generated value by this integer
|5    |count: number of values to generate in the simulation
|=======================
////

When running with no arguments, `simulate.sh` prints 1 number in the range of
1-100. Otherwise it generates n numbers of the form +(R*scale)+bias+
where R is the random integer being produced. By default it logs information about its
execution environment to `stderr`.  Here are some examples of its usage:

-----
$ simulate.sh 2>log
       5
$ head -4 log

-----

stats.sh
~~~~~~~~

The `stats.sh` script serves as a trivial model of an "analysis"
program. It reads N files each containing M integers and simply prints
the average of all those numbers to `stdout`. Similarly to `simulate.sh`
it logs environmental information to the `stderr`. After you redirect the
outputs of `simulate.sh` to files, you can do:

-----
$ ls f*
f1  f2  f3  f4

$ cat f*
25
60
40
75

$ stats.sh f* 2>log

*Tutorial Section One*
----------------------
This tutorial is only for running on localhost. See Section Two for tutorial on running jobs on 
remote resources.

/////
Basic of the Swift language with local execution
------------------------------------------------
/////

A Summary of Swift in a nutshell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Swift scripts are text files ending in `.swift` The `swift` command
runs on any host, and executes these scripts. `swift` is a Java
application, which you can install almost anywhere.  On Linux, just
unpack the distribution `tar` file and add its `bin/` directory to
your `PATH`.

* Swift scripts run ordinary applications, just like shell scripts
do. Swift makes it easy to run these applications on parallel and
remote computers (from laptops to supercomputers). If you can `ssh` to
the system, Swift can likely run applications there.

* The details of where to run applications and how to get files back
and forth are described in configuration files separate from your
program. Swift speaks ssh, PBS, Condor, SLURM, LSF, SGE, Cobalt, and
Globus to run applications, and scp, http, ftp, and GridFTP to move
data.

* The Swift language has 5 main data types: `boolean`, `int`,
`string`, `float`, and `file`. Collections of these are dynamic,
sparse arrays of arbitrary dimension and structures of scalars and/or
arrays defined by the `type` declaration.

* Swift file variables are "mapped" to external files. Swift sends
files to and from remote systems for you automatically.

* Swift variables are "single assignment": once you set them you can't
change them (in a given block of code).  This makes Swift a natural,
"parallel data flow" language. This programming model keeps your
workflow scripts simple and easy to write and understand.

* Swift lets you define functions to "wrap" application programs, and
to cleanly structure more complex scripts. Swift `app` functions take
files and parameters as inputs and return files as outputs.

* A compact set of built-in functions for string and file
manipulation, type conversions, high level IO, etc. is provided.
Swift's equivalent of `printf()` is `tracef()`, with limited and
slightly different format codes.

* Swift's `foreach{}` statement is the main parallel workhorse of the
language, and executes all iterations of the loop concurrently. The
actual number of parallel tasks executed is based on available
resources and settable "throttles".

* In fact, Swift conceptually executes *all* the statements,
expressions and function calls in your program in parallel, based on
data flow. These are similarly throttled based on available resources
and settings.

* Swift also has `if` and `switch` statements for conditional
execution. These are seldom needed in simple workflows but they enable
very dynamic workflow patterns to be specified.

We'll see many of these points in action in the examples below. Let's
get started!

Example 1: Run a single application under Swift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first Swift script, `p1.swift`, runs `simulate.sh` to generate a
single random number. It writes the number to a file.

image::part01.png["p1 workflow",align="center"]

.p1.swift
-----
sys::[cat ../part01/p1.swift]
-----


To run this script, run the following command:
-----
$ cd part01
$ swift p1.swift
Swift 0.95 Branch SVN swift-r7903 cog-r3908
RunID: run001
Progress: Tue, 03 Jun 2014 15:01:28-0500
Final status:Tue, 03 Jun 2014 15:01:29-0500  Finished successfully:1
$ cat sim.out
      84
$ swift p1.swift
$ cat sim.out
      36
-----

To cleanup the directory and remove all outputs (including the log
files and directories that Swift generates), run the `cleanup` script
which is located in the tutorial `$PATH`:

-----
$ cleanup
-----
//[source,bash]
//-----
//$ cleanup
//-----

[NOTE]
===== 
You will find a Swift configuration file `swift.properties` 
in each `partNN` directory in the tutorial folder. It defines properties 
that control the parallelism involved in the swift execution. It also defines 
properties such as the work directory and the scheduler to use. The specifics will 
be explained in more detail in the second section of the tutorial, and can be 
ignored for now. 
=====

Example 2: Running an ensemble of many apps in parallel with a "foreach" loop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `p2.swift` script introduces the `foreach` parallel iteration
construct to run many concurrent simulations.

image::part02.png[align="center"]

.p2.swift
-----
sys::[cat ../part02/p2.swift]
-----

The script also shows an example of naming the output files of an ensemble 
run. In this case, the output files will be named `output/sim_N.out`.

To run the script and view the output:
-----
$ cd ../part02
$ swift p2.swift
$ ls output
sim_0.out  sim_1.out  sim_2.out  sim_3.out  sim_4.out  sim_5.out  sim_6.out  sim_7.out  sim_8.out  sim_9.out
$ more output/*

output/sim_1.out
::::::::::::::
      55
...

::::::::::::::
output/sim_9.out
::::::::::::::
      82
-----

Example 3: Analyzing results of a parallel ensemble
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After all the parallel simulations in an ensemble run have completed,
it is typically necessary to gather and analyze their results with some
kind of post-processing analysis program or script.  `p3.swift`
introduces such a postprocessing step. In this case, the files created
by all of the parallel runs of `simulation.sh` will be averaged by by
the trivial "analysis application" `stats.sh`:

image::part03.png[align="center"]

.p3.swift
----
sys::[cat ../part03/p3.swift]
----

To run:
----
$ cd part03
$ swift p3.swift
----

Note that in `p3.swift` we expose more of the capabilities of the
`simulate.sh` application to the `simulation()` app function:

-----
app (file o) simulation (int sim_steps, int sim_range, int sim_values)
{
  simulate "--timesteps" sim_steps "--range" sim_range "--nvalues" sim_values stdout=filename(o);
}
-----

`p3.swift` also shows how to fetch application-specific values from
the `swift` command line in a Swift script using `arg()` which
accepts a keyword-style argument and its default value:

-----
int nsim   = toInt(arg("nsim","10"));
int steps  = toInt(arg("steps","1"));
int range  = toInt(arg("range","100"));
int values = toInt(arg("values","5"));
-----

Now we can specify that more runs should be performed and that each should 
run for more timesteps, and produce more that one value each, within a specified 
range, using command line arguments placed after the Swift script name in the 
form `-parameterName=value`:

-----
$ swift p3.swift -nsim=3 -steps=10 -values=4 -range=1000000

Now that we've seen how to use Swift to complete simple jobs for you 
on your local machine, we can now proceed to learning how to run 
similar workflows on remote machines.

*Tutorial Section Two*
----------------------

When you have access to other resources that you wish to run jobs on, 
you can simply state `-site=XX` (where `XX` is the name of the resource) on the command line 
following the usual command given to run Swift. With the right configuration 
specifications, Swift will automatically connect you to the target machine and 
start the jobs there. 

For example, if you are already logged in on a certain machine and you wish to run 
jobs locally, you can do:
-----
$ swift p1.swift -site=local
-----
Then Swift will complete the jobs for you on the login node.

You can use `part01-03` to run the same workflows as in Section One on the local 
node as an exercise. You will learn more examples for running on remote sites using 
`part04-06` introduced in the following section.

[NOTE]
=====
You have to have Swift installed on the headnode to run jobs! See Swift Installation for 
instructions. However, you do not need to do the same for the remote sites as Swift service will be 
automatically carried over.
=====

Example 4: Running a simple app on remote node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In `p4.swift`, there is a simple `app` which takes a file containing random numbers and `sort` them before returning a sorted output. In the `part04` 
folder  we have a file, `unsorted.txt`, which contains 100 random integers ranging from 0 to 99 and we wish to run the job on a remote node.

.p4.swift
-----
type file;

app (file out) sortdata (file unsorted)
{
  sort "-n" "unsorted.txt" stdout=filename(out);
}

file unsorted <"unsorted.txt">;
file sorted <"sorted.txt">;

sorted = sortdata(unsorted);
-----

Since `sort` has most likely already been implemented on the remote node, all we need to do is send the `unsorted.txt` to the node and specify the 
location where you want to run the job on the command line, using `-site=XX`. After the job completes we will get a 
sorted file  `sorted.txt` back to the local machine.

For example, to run the job remotely on Midway and to view the output:
-----
$ cd ../part04
$ swift p4.swift -site=midway-remote

-----

Example 5: Running a parallel ensemble on compute nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`p5.swift` will run our mock "simulation" applications on compute nodes. The script is almost the same 
as `p3.swift`, but specifies that each `simulation` app invocation should additionally return 
the log file which the application writes to `stderr`. 

.p5.swift
-----
type file;

app (file out, file log) simulation (int sim_steps, int sim_range, int sim_values, file sim_script)
{
  bash "simulate.sh" "--timesteps" sim_steps "--range" sim_range "--nvalues" sim_values stdout=filename(out) stderr=filename(log);
}

app (file out, file log) analyze (file s[], file stat_script)
{
  bash "stats.sh" filenames(s) stdout=filename(out) stderr=filename(log);
}

int nsim   = toInt(arg("nsim",   "10"));
int steps  = toInt(arg("steps",  "1"));
int range  = toInt(arg("range",  "100"));
int values = toInt(arg("values", "5"));

file simulate_script <"simulate.sh">;
file stats_script <"stats.sh">;

file sims[];

foreach i in [0:nsim-1] {
  file simout <single_file_mapper; file=strcat("output/sim_",i,".out")>;
  file simlog <single_file_mapper; file=strcat("output/sim_",i,".log")>;
  (simout,simlog) = simulation(steps,range,values,simulate_script);
  sims[i] = simout;
}

file stats_out<"output/average.out">;
file stats_log<"output/average.log">;
(stats_out, stats_log) = analyze(sims, stats_script);
-----

Note that since `simulate` and `stats` are no longer in the `$PATH` of the remote site, we need to pass both `simulate.sh` and `stats.sh` as 
arguments to the `app`s to send them there and use `bash` to invoke them to be able to use them.

Now when you run `swift p5.swift` you will see that two types of output files will be placed in 
the `output/` directory: `sim_N.out` and `sim_N.log`. The log files provide data on the runtime 
environment of each app invocation.

-----

...
-----
////

In order to run `p5.swift` on compute nodes instead of on the headnode, you can again specify it on the command 
line. For example, if you are on Midway, instead of running locally, you can run:
-----
$ swift p5.swift -site=midway
-----

The site names can be defined in the Swift's `swift.properties` configuration file. The 
file allows many parameters to specify how jobs should be run on a given site.

Consider, for example, that Midway has several Slurm partitions. The sandyb partition has 16 
cores, and the westmere partition has 12 cores. Depending on the application and which partitions 
are busy, you may want to modify where you run in the `jobQueue` specification:
-----
site.midway {
   jobManager=slurm
   jobQueue=westmere
   tasksPerWorker=4
   initialScore=10000
   filesystem=local
   jobproject=pi-wilde    # Put your own project ID here
   workdir=/scratch/midway/$USER/work
}
-----
By setting the `tasksPerWorker` to the desired number of parallel application 
invocations it is possible to take advantage of multiple cores in the processor. 
The `taskThrottle` variable is used to limit number of tasks sent to workers 
for execution. Both `tasksPerWorker` and `taskThrottle` are set to 2 in the tutorial 
and could be set to the number of cores available on your machine.
You should also make sure to change `workdir` to your own directory on the site.

You can also execute jobs remotely from your own machine by setting `jobManager` to the 
full path of the scheduler.

For example, if you run:
-----
$ swift p5.swift -site=midway-remote
-----
Swift will `ssh` to the target site and start the jobs there.

`swift.properties` will therefore look like this:
-----
site.midway-remote {
   jobManager=midway.rcc.uchicago.edu:slurm
   jobQueue=westmere
   tasksPerWorker=12
   initialScore=10000
   filesystem=local
   jobproject=pi-wilde    # Put your own project ID here
   workdir=/scratch/midway/$USER/work
}
-----

Note that if you have a different `$USER` name on your working site from your 
local machine, you should change the  `workdir` accordingly to the correct one.

With the right specifications, you can define your own site using similar 
property settings. Swift will then be able to run anywhere you want.

More explanations on setting the configuration file will be found in the User Guide.

[NOTE]
=====
Make sure you have passphraseless accesses to all sites 
to ensure a smooth workflow. This can be done by identifying yourself with 
your public key on all remote sites. Here is a tutorial for doing this:

=====

Example 6: Controlling the compute-node pools where applications run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`p6.swift` is exactly the same as `p5.swift` with one exception: `simulate.sh` and `stats.sh` 
are executed using `remote_sh` and `local_sh` respectively instead of `bash`.

.p6.swift
-----
type file;

app (file out, file log) simulation (int sim_steps, int sim_range, int sim_values, file sim_script)
{
  remote_sh "simulate.sh" "--timesteps" sim_steps "--range" sim_range "--nvalues" sim_values stdout=filename(out) stderr=filename(log);
}

app (file out, file log) analyze (file s[], file stat_script)
{
  local_sh "stats.sh" filenames(s) stdout=filename(out) stderr=filename(log);
}

int nsim   = toInt(arg("nsim",   "10"));
int steps  = toInt(arg("steps",  "1"));
int range  = toInt(arg("range",  "100"));
int values = toInt(arg("values", "5"));

file sims[];
file simulate_script <"simulate.sh">;
file stats_script <"stats.sh">;

foreach i in [0:nsim-1] {
  file simout <single_file_mapper; file=strcat("output/sim_",i,".out")>;
  file simlog <single_file_mapper; file=strcat("output/sim_",i,".log")>;
  (simout,simlog) = simulation(steps,range,values,simulate_script);
  sims[i] = simout;
}

file stats_out<"output/average.out">;
file stats_log<"output/average.log">;
(stats_out, stats_log) = analyze(sims,stats_script);
-----

This modification can be used to control where you run your applications. In order to do this, 
you need to define *each* of the `apps` you used inside your application declarations to specify 
where they come from. They should be put in the `swift.properties` in the following form:
-----
app.<site>.<app_name>=<path_to_executable>
-----
By setting an "app location" property in the `swift.properties`, you are explicitly setting the 
sites on which the `app` is allowed to run and the executable to be used on that site. A point 
to note is that, if there is no `app` defined in the `swift.properties`, Swift will assume that 
every `app` in the Swift script is free to run on all defined sites. But if any single `app` 
is defined in the `swift.properties`, Swift expects to see `app` property for every `app` used. 
For example:

////
Right now Swift will 
execute each of the `apps` on every site where it is able to be located in `$PATH`. 
Therefore, 
////

.Definition for app `simulation`
-----
app.midway.remote_sh=/bin/bash
-----
It indicates that the app `remote_sh` should be executed using `/bin/bash` and Swift 
will look for it on a site named `midway` to run the `simulation` application.

.Definition for app `analyze`
-----
app.local.local_sh=/bin/bash
-----
Similarly, Swift will look for `/bin/sh` locally to execute the `analyze` application.

////
For another example, let us take another look at `p1.swift`:
-----
type file;

app (file o) simulation ()
{
  simulate stdout=filename(o);
}

file f <"sim.out">;
f = simulation();
-----

If you define app `simulate` like this:
-----
app.local.simulate=$PWD/simulate.sh
-----
It indicates that the app `simulate` is located in the file `simulate.sh` and since 
the path `simulate.sh` is specified with no directory components, Swift expects that 
`simulate.sh` executable will be available in your `$PATH`.
////

.Specifying sites in configuration file
If you are used to running jobs on a fixed combination of sites and don't want to type 
out the names every single time, you can also specify them in `swift.properties` 
by doing `site=XX, XX, ...` For example, instead of running:
-----
$ swift p6.swift -site=midway-remote,local
-----
You can just say this in `swift.properties`:
-----
site=midway-remote,local
-----
Then if you have defined *all* your `apps` in the configuration file correctly,
when you run `swift p5.swift` Swift will execute each of the `apps` on the 
corresponding site that you specified.

Example 7: Specifying more complex workflow patterns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`p7.swift` expands the workflow pattern of `p6.swift` to add additional
stages to the workflow. Here, we generate a dynamic seed value that
will be used by all of the simulations to initialize the random number 
generator, so that there are some dependencies to the numbers being generated. 
For each simulation, we also run a pre-processing application to generate a unique "bias
file" (Remeber the form `(R*scale)+bias`). This pattern is shown below, followed by the Swift script.

.p7.swift
----
type file;

# Main script and data
file simulate_script <"simulate.sh">;
file stats_script <"stats.sh">;
file seedfile <"output/seed.dat">;        # Dynamically generated bias for simulation ensemble

}

app (file out, file log) simulation (int timesteps, int sim_range,
                                     file bias_file, int scale, int sim_count,
                                     file sim_script, file seed_file)
{
  bash "simulate.sh" "-t" timesteps "-r" sim_range "-B" filename(bias_file) "-x" scale
           "-n" sim_count "-S" filename(seed_file) stdout=filename(out) stderr=filename(log);

}

# Command line arguments

int  steps = toInt(arg("steps",  "1"));   # number of timesteps (seconds) per simulation
int  range = toInt(arg("range",  "100")); # range of the generated random numbers
int  values = toInt(arg("values", "10"));  # number of values generated per simulation

tracef("\n*** Script parameters: nsim=%i range=%i num values=%i\n\n", nsim, range, values);
seedfile = genseed(1, simulate_script);	# pass the simulate.sh script to the remote site as an argument

file sims[];                      # Array of files to hold each simulation output

foreach i in [0:nsim-1] {
  file biasfile <single_file_mapper; file=strcat("output/bias_",i,".dat")>;
  file simout   <single_file_mapper; file=strcat("output/sim_",i,".out")>;
  file simlog   <single_file_mapper; file=strcat("output/sim_",i,".log")>;
  biasfile = genbias(1000, 20, simulate_script);
  (simout,simlog) = simulation(steps, range, biasfile, 1000000, values, simulate_script, seedfile);
  sims[i] = simout;
}

file stats_out<"output/average.out">;
file stats_log<"output/average.log">;
(stats_out,stats_log) = analyze(sims, stats_script);
----

Note that the workflow is based on data flow dependencies: each simulation 
depends on the single seed value, calculated in this statement:
-----
seedfile = genseed(1, simulate_script);
-----
The bias file is computed and then consumed in these two dependent statements:
-----
  biasfile = genbias(1000, 20, simulate_script);
  (simout,simlog) = simulation(steps, range, biasfile, 1000000, values, simulate_script, seedfile);
-----

To run:
----
$ cd ../part07
$ swift p7.swift

The default parameters result in the following execution log:

We produce 20 values in each bias file. Simulations of less than that
number of values ignore the unneeded number, while simualtions of more
than 20 will use the last bias number for all remaining values past
20.  As an exercise, adjust the code to produce the same number of
bias values as is needed for each simulation.  As a further exercise,
modify the script to generate a unique seed value for each simulation,
which is a common practice in ensemble computations.

Performing larger Swift runs and Plotting run activities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To test with larger runs, you can change the command line arguments. The 
example below will run 1000 simulations with each simulation taking 5 seconds:
-----
$ swift p7.swift -steps=5 -nsim=1000
-----

The tutorial `bin` directory in your `$PATH` provides a script
`plot.sh` to plot the progress of a Swift script.  It generates two
image files: `activeplot.png`, which shows the number of active jobs
over time, and `cumulativeplot.png`, which shows the total number of
app calls completed as the Swift script progresses.

After each Swift run, a new run directory is created called `runNNN`.
Each run directory will have a log file with a similar name called
`runNNN.log`. Once you have identified the log file name, run the 
command `plot.sh <logfile>` to generate the plots for that
specific run. For example:

-----
$ ls
output  p3.swift  run000  swift.properties

$ cd run000/

$ ls
apps  cf  p3-20131202-2004-0kh4ha6e.d  run000.log  sites.xml

$ plot.sh run000.log 
-----

This can thus yield plots like the following:

image::activeplot.png[width=700,align=center]
image::cumulativeplot.png[width=700,align=center]

Above is commented out for further use.
