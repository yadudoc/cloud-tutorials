PLAN

basics
cloud
uc3
multisystems
(modis)

get hosts.txt for cloud dynamically

Show variety of UC3 activity and what ran where

get hostname and app_resources into provider staging (hostname into all _swiftwrap)

Show gridftp and go connect to process the modis dataset

Show SwiftR for R users, SwiftPy for Enthought PY?

fetching apps vs sending apps vs parrot/cvmfs/oasis etc ????

Demo script-aps, bin apps, building apps, caching apps. etc.

Do a Swift BLAST workflow  -- with viz !!!  (spice it up with help from Dina)

OSG page from Mats: "Is your job HTC-ready"

Use new Trunk config in tutorial?


Add viz and status display; add node probing to tutorial.

Debug failure with pinfiles


What "exercises to suggest?"

- run stats app locally
- installed vs transferred apps
- transferred programs vs transferred scripts
- summarize things about the env from the .log files, ala stats.

Y-style dag: 2 sims and average

Show how to find temp files at runtime...

Show how to find hung processes at runtime...  (or get other trace data...)

make your owb versions of the programs; verify that you can substitute them

Add a layer to isolate shell version v installed version

Show how to handle a paramfile

Test if OSGCOnnect works and account string (PorjectName) works OK for both!

SHow how to handle long lists of files (eg writeData and other swift.properties)

Expand arith to arb prec using bc


ISSUES

error in pin files? debug and turn back on
PATH issues for various providers

bin dir?

setup.csh and .csh testing

From Yadu:

I've committed all the changes that I made on Friday and you can get them 
from -> https://svn.ci.uchicago.edu/svn/vdl2/SwiftTutorials/CIC_2013-08-09

I'm trying to make this tutorial easily work on several sites so that, we
do not have to tweak things for every single tutorial. Once this is done,
I can also add it to the test-battery as well. I think this has value 
considering that we spend atleast 1-2 days for every demo.

Now, the major pending item is the Modis demo, specifically the issue of 
bringing data to any site and scripts. Slight tweaks to allow for sending
the scripts as args to apps would also be needed.

So the major changes are: 
1. Source the setup.sh script with the target site name
eg. source setups.sh <cloud|uc3|midway|beagle>
2. No separate cloud folder
3. [pending] fix modis data and scripts
4. [pending] support for zsh and other shells?
